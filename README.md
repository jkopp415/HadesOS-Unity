# HadesOS-Unity
Unity project for HadesOS

<b>Note:</b> Make sure to use Unity Editor version 2021.3.2f1 (LTS). Writing the multiple .gitignores was very finicky, so we don't want to be adding any more uneccessary files. If I missed something, and Git is asking to commit something that looks like a log file or a user-specific setting and you're not too sure if it's necessesary, double check with someone else first.
